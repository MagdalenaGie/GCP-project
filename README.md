# Description
send notifications to a Slack channel when a Dataflow job fails
The aim of this project is to send notifications to a Slack channel about a Dataflow job result - success or failure. I will use Cloud Logging to send Dataflow job status messages to a Cloud Function using Pub/Sub. After that, the Cloud Function calls a Slack webhook to send the notification to channel.
